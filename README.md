# Welcome to Petstore!

## Development

Step 1: Clone the repository (or unzip the project folder):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Relionnn/petstore.git
cd petstore
```

Step 2: Install the necessary npm packages:

```sh
npm install
```

Step 3: Run the app in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Step:1 Build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Step2: Run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
